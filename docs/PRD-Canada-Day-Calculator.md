## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Existing COBOL Program Analysis
**Program:** CANDAY01 - Canada Day Calculator

**Core Functionality:**
- Interactive console application
- Accepts year input from user (range: 1600-3000)
- Calculates day of the week for Canada Day (July 1st) for given year
- Displays formatted results with fun facts
- Supports multiple calculations in a single session
- Input validation and error handling

**Technical Characteristics:**
- Console-based user interface
- Sequential processing model
- Simple data structures
- Basic error handling
- Procedural programming approach

### 2.2 Business Rules Identified
1. **Date Calculation**: Canada Day is always July 1st
2. **Year Range**: Accept years between 1600 and 3000
3. **Day of Week Logic**: Use standard calendar calculations
4. **User Experience**: Provide contextual fun facts based on day of week
5. **Session Management**: Allow multiple calculations per session
