### Key Features Covered

✅ Multi-country support (150+ countries)  
✅ Regional holiday variations  
✅ Multiple calendar systems (Gregorian, Lunar, Religious)  
✅ Historical and future date calculations  
✅ API and integration capabilities  
✅ Multiple export formats (iCalendar, CSV, JSON, PDF)  
✅ Search and discovery features  
✅ Performance and scalability requirements  
✅ Security and compliance considerations  
✅ Internationalization support  

## Purpose

This PRD was created to:

1. **Generalize** the existing single-country holiday calculator (Canada Day example)
2. **Define** business requirements independent of implementation language
3. **Enable** system rebuilding in any programming language
4. **Provide** clear specifications for stakeholders and development teams
5. **Establish** foundation for user stories and acceptance criteria

## Key Differentiators

🔹 **Language-Agnostic:** No COBOL-specific terminology - suitable for any tech stack  
🔹 **Comprehensive:** Covers functional, non-functional, and business requirements  
🔹 **Actionable:** Includes detailed user stories and acceptance criteria  
🔹 **Risk-Aware:** Identifies and mitigates 14 key project risks  
🔹 **Realistic:** 12-month phased timeline with clear milestones  

## Target Audience

- **Product Managers** - Understanding system scope and requirements
- **Business Stakeholders** - Evaluating business value and investment
- **Development Teams** - Planning implementation in any language
- **Project Managers** - Planning timeline and resources
- **QA Teams** - Creating test strategies
