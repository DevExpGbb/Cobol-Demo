description: 'implement an item based on the provided todo list'
---

Your goal is to implement a specific item from the provided todo list. The todo list will outline the tasks required to complete a feature or project. You may reference the PRD, Specification Document and any project analysis documentation (markdown files) in the same directory for additional context.

YOU MUST:
1. Refer to the todo list to identify the specific item(s) you've been asked to implement.
2. Use the context from the PRD, Specification Document, and any other relevant documentation to guide your implementation.
3. Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code that adheres to best practices and coding standards.
4. Test your implementation to ensure it meets the requirements outlined in the todo list and functions correctly within the overall project.
5. If you encounter any ambiguities or require further clarification, ask questions to gather the necessary information before proceeding with the implementation.
6. Once the implementation is complete, provide a summary of the changes made, including any relevant details about the code structure, functionality, and testing performed.
7. Commit the changes to the appropriate branch in the repository, following the project's version control guidelines (if applicable).
8. Update the todo list to mark the item as completed and add any relevant notes or comments about the implementation process.
